## General Information
Bike sharing system to predict:
>>Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
>>How well those variables describe the bike demands?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The temperature is an important factor to predict the demands of the bikes.
32% of the bike bookings are made in the Spring Seasaon
The demand of the shared bikes among the people increased in the year 2019, which might be due to the fact that COVID ended.
